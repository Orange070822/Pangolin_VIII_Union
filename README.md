<h2> How do we implement the functions ? </h2>

> "The hardest thing is not to come up with an idea , but how to implement it in Minecraft" -- Chenmotxt(206~ )

In fact , we <strong> don't </strong> create a mod to implement the funcitons we've come up with , instead , we use <strong> Command Blocks </strong> to generate out customized things. Therefore , we need json tags to differ them from vanilla items . <br>
